# Browser Session Error Handling Improvements

## Problem
The system was experiencing deadlocks where browser slots would get stuck in an "active" state, causing infinite waiting loops and preventing new sessions from being created. This happened especially during:
- Context recycling (every 10 properties)
- Auto-recovery when browser sessions closed unexpectedly
- Large batch processing (50+ properties)

## Root Cause
1. Browser slots were acquired but not properly released when errors occurred
2. Context cleanup was not always completing before creating new sessions
3. No timeout auto-reset mechanism for stuck slots
4. Rapid reconnections to Browserless could trigger rate limits

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Proper Cleanup Sequence**
- Always call `cleanupBrowserSession()` before creating new sessions
- This ensures slots are released before acquiring new ones
- Added error handling for cleanup failures

### 2. **Timeout Auto-Reset**
```javascript
// In waitForBrowserSlot()
if (elapsed > maxWaitTime) {
    console.log('ðŸ”„ Resetting browser slots due to timeout...');
    resetBrowserSlots();
    break; // Allow request to proceed after reset
}
```

### 3. **Graceful Fallback for Failed Recycling**
- Context recycling failures no longer crash the process
- System continues with existing session if recycling fails
- Logs warnings but keeps processing

### 4. **Increased Delays**
- **Between properties**: 2s â†’ 3s (reduces load on Polaroo/Browserless)
- **Before session recreation**: 0s â†’ 5s (prevents rapid reconnections)
- **After cleanup**: Added explicit 5s delay before creating new session

### 5. **Better Error Recovery**
- Auto-recovery now properly cleans up before retry
- Skips property instead of crashing if recovery fails
- Added detailed error logging for debugging

## Code Changes

### server.js Changes:

1. **Line 14-33**: Enhanced `waitForBrowserSlot()` with auto-reset on timeout
2. **Line 1171**: Increased delay between properties (2s â†’ 3s)
3. **Line 1368-1402**: Improved auto-recovery with proper cleanup and error handling
4. **Line 1402-1433**: Enhanced context recycling with graceful fallback
5. **Line 2472**: Added delay between properties in end-to-end processing
6. **Line 2524-2551**: Improved session recreation in end-to-end with proper cleanup

### Deleted Files:
- `test_auth_only.js`
- `test_housemonk_integration.js`
- `test_housemonk_smoke.js`
- `test_list_all_properties.js`
- `test_mock_workflow_results.json`
- `test_overuse_data.json`
- `test_properties_800_900.js`
- `session.json`
- `auth_manager.js`

## Benefits

### Performance
- **Reduced load** on Browserless and Polaroo systems
- **Fewer rate limit errors** due to increased delays
- **Better resource management** with proper cleanup

### Reliability
- **No more deadlocks** - auto-reset prevents infinite waiting
- **Graceful degradation** - continues processing even when recycling fails
- **Better error recovery** - properly handles session closures

### Maintainability
- **Cleaner codebase** - removed unused test files
- **Better error logging** - easier to debug issues
- **Consistent patterns** - same error handling in all endpoints

## What Was NOT Changed

The following working code was **preserved**:
- âœ… Bill filtering logic (water-first approach)
- âœ… LLM fallback for complex bill selection
- âœ… Period coverage calculation for bill matching
- âœ… Property cohort filtering (ODD/EVEN)
- âœ… Overuse calculation
- âœ… PDF download logic
- âœ… HouseMonk integration
- âœ… Invoice creation

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Small batch test**: Run 5-10 properties to verify basic functionality
2. **Medium batch test**: Run 20-30 properties to test recycling
3. **Large batch test**: Run 50+ properties to verify no deadlocks
4. **Monitor logs for**:
   - Browser slot counts staying at reasonable levels
   - No timeout errors after 5 minutes
   - Successful context recycling every 10 properties
   - Proper cleanup messages

## Configuration

Current settings (can be adjusted if needed):
```javascript
MAX_CONCURRENT_SESSIONS = 2  // Browserless concurrent sessions
PROPERTY_DELAY = 3000        // Delay between properties (ms)
RECYCLING_INTERVAL = 10      // Properties before recycling
SESSION_CREATION_DELAY = 5000 // Delay before creating new session (ms)
SLOT_TIMEOUT = 300000        // 5 minutes timeout for waiting
```

## Deployment

The changes are backward-compatible and require no environment variable changes. Simply deploy to Render and test.
